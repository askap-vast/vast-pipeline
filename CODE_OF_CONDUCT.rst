Code Of Conduct
===============

By joining the VAST collaboration you agree to adhere to the Code of Conduct below.
We are committed to making this collaboration productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of colleagues and students in any form.
To achieve this, VAST members must endeavour to work together in a cooperative way on scientific projects that fall within the scope of VAST. In particular all members must:

* Exercise their best professional and ethical judgement and carry out their duties and functions with integrity and objectivity;
* Act fairly and reasonably, and treat colleagues and students with respect, impartiality, courtesy and sensitivity;
* Avoid conflicts of interest;
* Adhere to the VAST membership and publication policies.

Please follow these guidelines in all your interactions (including online) within VAST:

* **Behave professionally**. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.
* **All communication should be appropriate** for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.
* **Be kind to others**. Do not insult or put down other collaboration members.
* Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the collaboration at the discretion of the PIs.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to speak, in confidence, to Tara Murphy (tara.murphy@sydney.edu.au) or David Kaplan (kaplan@uwm.edu).

Extra Guidelines
----------------

We are a community based on openness, as well as friendly and didactic discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

We ask that all VAST publications (papers, ATELs, etc) include the line::

    This work was done as part of the ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) collaboration
    (Murphy et al. 2013, PASA, 30, 6).

Separately, all refereed publications should carry the standard `CSIRO acknowledgement <https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/publications/Acknowledgements.html>`_::

    The Australian SKA Pathfinder is part of the Australia Telescope National Facility which is
    managed by CSIRO. Operation of ASKAP is funded by the Australian Government with support from
    the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. ASKAP uses the resources of the
    Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. Establishment of ASKAP, the Murchison Radio-astronomy
    Observatory and the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre are initiatives of the Australian
    Government, with support from the Government of Western Australia and the Science and
    Industry Endowment Fund. We acknowledge the Wajarri Yamatji people as the traditional owners
