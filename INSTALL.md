# VAST Pipeline - Installation Notes

This document explains how to install all the packages that the pipeline needs to run, as well as the PostgreSQL database. Following this documentation should get you started with a good __LOCAL__ development environment, where you can mess up things, but always go back and fix it up.

Note for installs on a Mac, the use of `homebrew` is recommended (https://brew.sh).

## PostgreSQL

I don't recommend installing the database as part of a system package (e.g. `apt-get install postgres`), but instead use docker, which let you mess up things and keep your database installation separated from the system packages. In this way you can easily destroy and re-create the database without messing up your OS installed packages.

Steps:

1. Installing docker in your system. Refer to [this official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and for Ubuntu users to [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Remember to add your `user` to the `docker` group [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/), by running

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

2. create your PostgreSQL container: `docker run --name NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 -d postgres:13.1`. This will install a PostgreSQL 13.1 container exposing the container internal port 5432 to your system (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`) at port `5432`. I encourage to change the localhost port (e.g. `5433:5432`) so you know you're in control! The command setup automatically a user `postgres` with password `postgres` and default database `postgres`. If everything goes well, you see your container up and running by issuing `docker ps`.

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
afnafnalkfo3        postgres:13.1        "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   22 hours ago        Up 22 hours         localhost:5432->5432/tcp   NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER
```

If `localhost` is not passed, the command exposes the port on `0.0.0.0` so other users on the same subnet (e.g. same WiFi access point) can connect to it (I don't recommend it for a local development environment!)

3. Install PostgreSQL dependency [`Q3C`](https://github.com/segasai/q3c):

	a. Connect to the container by running `docker exec -it NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER bash`. That runs `bash` shell as `root` inside the container.

	b. Install the packages, making sure the postgres version is same as the one installed in docker (version 13 in this case -- check version with `psql -U postgres`):

	```bash
	apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y libssl-dev libkrb5-dev zlib1g-dev make git gcc postgresql-server-dev-13 postgresql-common
	```
	c. Clone `Q3C` repo and install it:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/segasai/q3c.git
	cd q3c
	make
	make install
	```

You can disconnect from the container and the database installation should now be complete. You can connect to the database by running the `psql` CLI (Command Line Interface) by installing on your system (e.g. Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install postgres-common` or just `postgresql-client-common`, Mac: `brew install libpq`). Alternatively you can access the CLI by connecting to the container as described above (`docker exec -it NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER bash`). Finally connect to your PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres
```

Output

```bash
psql (YYYY (MYOS YYYY), server XXXX)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

The command will ask you for the password, please type `postgres`. The password is set by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres` environment variable at container initialization, and __CAN'T__ be changed afterward.

As you can see does not matter if the CLI client is for higher PostgreSQL versions, as it still connect to your instance ( e.g. `psql (11.0 (Ubuntu 11.0-2.pgdg18.04+1), server 13.1 (Debian 13.1-1.pgdg100+1))`).

Basic Start/Stop commands are `docker start NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER` and `docker stop NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER`. Remember to start your container after rebooting your machine, if you don't have docker daemon configured to autoload!

## Pipeline Python Environment
I strongly recommend to setup a virtual environment, in which you can then install all these `Python` modules into.
This will avoid conflicts either with the system version of python, or with other code that you have that require different versions of these modules.

Steps:
1. Install OS requirements:
- gcc
- python3-dev
- libpq-dev
- libgraphviz-dev (for development requirements)

For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpq-dev libgraphviz-dev
```

2. Copy repo link from `Clone or download` button and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <PASTE REPO LINK> && cd <REPO>
```
__NOTE__: DO NOT change the the folder name, e.g. `git clone https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-pipeline.git my-pipeline-local-dev`

3. Setup a `Python >= 3.6` virtual environment. E.g. with `virtualenv`:
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 pipeline_env
```
Otherwise use `Anaconda/conda`:
```bash
conda create -n pipeline_env python=3.6
```

__NOTE__: you can name the environment whatever you want instead of `pipeline_env`

4. Activate the environment.
```bash
source pipeline_env/bin/activate
```
Otherwise use `Anaconda/conda`:

```bash
conda activate pipeline_env
```

5. Install the development requirements

Note that if you want to install the development requirements, graphviz needs to be installed on your system (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`, Mac: `brew install graphviz`).

```bash
(pipeline_env)$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```
or with conda (some packages will not be installed properly so check and eventually install them manually, if not with `conda`, with `pip`):
```bash
(pipeline_env)$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements/dev.txt
(pipeline_env)$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements/base.txt
```

## Pipeline Front End Assets Quickstart
In order to install and compile the frontend assets (modules like js9 and bootstrap, as well as minification of JS and CSS files) you need a recent version of `node` with `npm` installed.

### Installation of `Node` and `npm`
We recommend install an node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Check the links for the latest version, but the time of writing, the following command will install `nvm` and `node `:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
command -v nvm && nvm install --lts || echo "nvm not found"
```
That would install `node v12.17.0` at the time of writing.

### Setting up the front end assets
In order to set up the front end assets, run:

```
$ pwd
/PATH/TO/REPO/vast-pipeline
$ npm ci && npm start
```

__NOTE__: make sure you are in the root of the repo, as shown above. That command "clean install" all the dependencies, copies files into the `static/vendor` folder and minified CSS and JS files. For more details of compilation of frontend assets (e.g. single tasks), and developement set up read the [Front End `README.md`](./static/README.md).

__NOTE__: When `npm start` or `npm run start` was run in a Ubuntu(20.04 LTS) virtual environment, for some unknown
reasons, both commands failed with the following error.

```

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /home/vast/.npm/_logs/2020-10-06T01_48_19_215Z-debug.log

```

The way around for this issue is unorthodox. The following steps were followed to overcome the issue:

```
$ cd node_modules/js9/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ cd ~/vast-pipeline/  ## (to comeback to the root folder of the project)
$ npm install
```
That somehow solved the issue mentioned above.

---

Done! Now open the [`README.md`](./README.md) file to see how to initialize and run the pipeline. Otherwise if you intend on developing the repo open the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how to contribute to the repo.
