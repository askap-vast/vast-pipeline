# SOURCE MONITORING OPTIONS
###
# Source monitoring can be done both forward and backward in 'time'.
# Monitoring backward means re-opening files that were previously processed and can be slow.
MONITOR = {{ monitor }}
# MONITOR_MIN_SIGMA defines the minimum SNR ratio a source has to be if it was placed in the
# area of minimum rms in the image from which it is to be extracted from. If lower than this
# value it is skipped
MONITOR_MIN_SIGMA = {{ monitor_min_sigma }}
# MONITOR_EDGE_BUFFER_SCALE is a multiplicative scaling factor to the buffer size of the
# forced photometry from the image edge.
MONITOR_EDGE_BUFFER_SCALE = {{ monitor_edge_buffer_scale }}

# The position uncertainty is in reality a combination of the fitting errors and the
# astrometric uncertainty of the image/survey/instrument.
# These two uncertainties are combined in quadrature.
# These two parameters are the astrometric uncertainty in ra/dec and they may be different
ASTROMETRIC_UNCERTAINTY_RA = {{ astrometric_uncertainty_ra }} # arcsec
ASTROMETRIC_UNCERTAINTY_DEC = {{ astrometric_uncertainty_dec }}  # arcsec

###
# OPTIONS THAT CONTROL THE SOURCE ASSOCIATION
###
ASSOCIATION_METHOD = '{{ association_method }}' # 'basic' or 'advanced'

# options that apply to basic association
ASSOCIATION_RADIUS = {{ association_radius }} # arcsec, basic only

# options that apply to advanced association
ASSOCIATION_DE_RUITER_RADIUS = {{ association_de_ruiter_radius }} # unitless, advanced only
ASSOCIATION_BEAMWIDTH_LIMIT = {{ association_beamwidth_limit }}   # multiplicative factor, advanced only

###
# OPTIONS THAT CONTROL THE NEW SOURCE ANALYSIS
###

# controls whether a source is labelled as a new source. The source in question
# must meet the requirement of:
# MIN_NEW_SOURCE_SIGMA > (source_peak_flux / lowest_previous_image_min_rms)
NEW_SOURCE_MIN_SIGMA = {{ new_source_min_sigma }}

# Default survey.
# Used by the website for analysis plots.
DEFAULT_SURVEY = {{ default_survey }} # 'NVSS'

# Minimum error to apply to all flux measurements. The actual value used will be the measured/
# reported value or this value, whichever is greater.
# This is a fraction, 0 = No minimum error
FLUX_PERC_ERROR = {{ flux_perc_error }} #percent 0.05 is 5%

# Replace the selavy errors witht
USE_CONDON_ERRORS = {{ use_condon_errors }}

# Sometimes the local rms for a source is reported as 0 by selavy.
# Choose a value to use for the local rms in these cases
SELAVY_LOCAL_RMS_ZERO_FILL_VALUE = {{ selavy_local_rms_zero_fill_value }}  # mJy
