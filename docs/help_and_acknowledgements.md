## Getting Help

The best way to get help with the VAST Pipeline software is to contact the development team on GitHub. If you have encountered a specific problem while using the pipeline or attempting to install any of the components, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-pipeline/issues/new). If you have a more general question or an idea for a new feature, please create a [new discussion thread](https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-pipeline/discussions/new).

General enquiries may also be sent via email to the VAST project Principal Investigators:
