# VAST Pipeline - Installation Notes

This document explains how to install all the packages that the pipeline needs to run, as well as the PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline main stack require setting up 3 things:

1. the database to serve the web app
2. the Python environment
3. the front-end assets, namely HTML, CSS and Javascript

Following this documentation should get you started with a good __LOCAL__ development environment, where you can mess up things, but always go back and fix it up.



## Assumptions/Notes

* The instructions are valid for Debian-based Linux OS and Mac OS.
* Note for installs on a Mac, the use of `homebrew` is recommended (https://brew.sh).

## PostgreSQL

We don't recommend installing the database as part of a system package (e.g. `apt-get install postgres`), but instead use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which let you mess up things and keep your database installation separated from the system packages. In this way you can easily destroy and re-create the database without messing up your OS installed packages.

Steps:

1. Installing docker in your system. Refer to [this official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and for Ubuntu users to [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Remember to add your `user` to the `docker` group [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/), by running

    ```bash
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

2. create your PostgreSQL container: `docker run --name NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 -d postgres`. This will install a PostgreSQL 12.1 container exposing the container internal port 5432 to your system (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`) at port `5432`. I encourage to change the localhost port (e.g. `5433:5432`) so you know you're are in control! The command setup automatically a user `postgres` with password `postgres` and default database `postgres`. If everything goes well, you see your container up and running by issuing `docker ps`.

    ```bash
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED                STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    afnafnalkfo3        postgres:12.1        "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   22 hours ago        Up 22 hours         localhost:5432->5432/tcp   NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER
    ```

    If `localhost` is not passed, the command exposes the port on `0.0.0.0` so other users on the same subnet (e.g. same WiFi access point) can connect to it (I don't recommend it for a local development environment!)

3. Install PostgreSQL dependency [`Q3C`](https://github.com/segasai/q3c):

	a. Connect to the container by running `docker exec -it NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER bash`. That runs `bash` shell as `root` inside the container.

	b. Install the packages, replace XX with the postgres version installed in docker (check version with `psql -U postgres`):

	   ``` bash
	   apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y libssl-dev libkrb5-dev zlib1g-dev make git gcc postgresql-server-dev-XX postgresql-common
       ```
	c. Clone `Q3C` repo and install it:

	   ```bash
	   git clone https://github.com/segasai/q3c.git
	   cd q3c
	   make
	   make install
	   ```

You can disconnect from the container and the database installation should now be complete. You can connect to the database by running the `psql` CLI (Command Line Interface) by installing on your system (e.g. Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install postgres-common` or just `postgresql-client-common`, Mac: `brew install libpq`). Alternatively you can access the CLI by connecting to the container as described above (`docker exec -it NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER bash`). Finally connect to your PostgreSQL instance:

``` bash linenums="1"
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres
```

Output

``` bash linenums="1"
psql (YYYY (MYOS YYYY), server XXXX)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

The command will ask you for the password, please type `postgres`. The password is set by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres` environment variable at container initialization, and __CAN'T__ be changed afterward.

As you can see does not matter if the CLI client is for higher PostgreSQL versions, as it still connect to your instance ( e.g. `psql (11.0 (Ubuntu 11.0-2.pgdg18.04+1), server 12.1 (Debian 12.1-1.pgdg100+1))`).

Basic Start/Stop commands are `docker start NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER` and `docker stop NAME_OF_MyCONTAINER`. Remember to start your container after rebooting your machine, if you don't have docker daemon configured to autoload!

## Python Environment
I strongly recommend to setup a virtual environment, in which you can then install all these `Python` modules into.
This will avoid conflicts either with the system version of python, or with other code that you have that require different versions of these modules.

Steps:

1. Install OS requirements:

   a. gcc
   b. python3-dev
   c. libpq-dev
   d. libgraphviz-dev (for development requirements)
   For Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpq-dev libgraphviz-dev
   ```

2. Copy repo link from `Clone or download` button and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <PASTE REPO LINK> && cd <REPO>
```

__NOTE__: DO NOT change the the folder name, e.g. `git clone https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-pipeline.git my-pipeline-local-dev`

3. Setup a `Python >= 3.6` virtual environment. E.g. with `virtualenv`:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 pipeline_env
```

Otherwise use `Anaconda/conda`:

```bash
conda create -n pipeline_env python=3.6
```

__NOTE__: you can name the environment whatever you want instead of `pipeline_env`

4. Activate the environment.
```bash
source pipeline_env/bin/activate
```
Otherwise use `Anaconda/conda`:

```bash
conda activate pipeline_env
```

5. Install the development requirements

Note that if you want to install the development requirements, graphviz needs to be installed on your system (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`, Mac: `brew install graphviz`).

```bash
(pipeline_env)$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```
or with conda (some packages will not be installed properly so check and eventually install them manually, if not with `conda`, with `pip`):
```bash
(pipeline_env)$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements/dev.txt
(pipeline_env)$ while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements/base.txt
```

## Front-End Assets Quickstart
In order to install and compile the front-end assets (modules like js9 and bootstrap, as well as minification of JS and CSS files) you need a recent version of `node` with `npm` installed.

### Installation of `Node` and `npm`
We recommend install an node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Check the links for the latest version, but the time of writing, the following command will install `nvm` and `node `:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
command -v nvm && nvm install --lts || echo "nvm not found"
```
That would install `node v12.17.0` at the time of writing.

### Setting up the front-end assets
In order to set up the front end assets, run:

```
$ pwd
/PATH/TO/REPO/vast-pipeline
$ npm ci && npm start
```

__NOTE__: make sure you are in the root of the repo, as shown above. That command "clean install" all the dependencies, copies files into the `static/vendor` folder and minified CSS and JS files. For more details of compilation of front-end assets (e.g. single tasks), and development set up read the [Front End Developing Guidelines](../developing/localdevenv.md#frontend-assets-management-and-guidelines).

Done! Now go to [Vast Pipeline Configuration](configuration.md) file to see how to initialize and run the pipeline. Otherwise if you intend on developing the repo open the [Contributing and Developing Guidelines](../developing/intro.md) file for instructions on how to contribute to the repo.
