# Deleting a Run

Currently a run can only be deleted by an administrator via the command line interface, and is not able to be performed using the website. Please contact the administrator if you wish to delete a run.

Administrators can refer to the [`clearpiperun`](../adminusage/cli/#clearpiperun) command for details on how to reset a pipeline run.
